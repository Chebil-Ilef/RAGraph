**HUGO - Hierarchical Unified Graph Organizer (GraphFusion)**

HUGO is a modular Graph-RAG microservice that combines traditional retrieval-augmented generation with temporal knowledge graphs to deliver enhanced query understanding and explainable AI responses. The system addresses limitations in standard RAG approaches by incorporating relationship-aware reasoning and time-bounded fact management through sophisticated graph structures.

**Core Functionality:**

The system processes documents through a hybrid pipeline that extracts entities, relationships, and temporal assertions to build dynamic knowledge graphs alongside traditional vector embeddings. HUGO employs semantic chunking strategies and multi-modal extraction to maintain contextual coherence while supporting both text-based similarity search and graph traversal queries for complex relational reasoning.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Hybrid retrieval combining BM25, dense vector search, and graph-based relationship traversal
- Temporal knowledge graph construction with entity lifecycle management and time-bounded assertions
- Semantic chunking with coherence preservation for improved context quality
- API-first architecture supporting document ingestion, graph indexing, and query processing
- Self-hosted deployment using local models (Ollama) for complete data sovereignty
- Real-time graph updates without full re-indexing requirements

**Business Value:**

HUGO transforms document understanding from simple keyword matching to contextual relationship reasoning. By maintaining both semantic similarity and structured knowledge representations, the system enables complex queries that span multiple documents, track evolving information over time, and provide transparent reasoning paths. This approach significantly improves answer accuracy for relationship-heavy queries while maintaining explainability through graph-based evidence trails.

The system serves as a foundational knowledge infrastructure that can be integrated across different DYDON modules requiring enhanced document understanding and reasoning capabilities.
